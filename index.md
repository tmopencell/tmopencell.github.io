### Me

I am director at [**OpenCell**](https://opencell.bio) London. We build biotech labs in shipping containers. I enjoy working accross disciplines, especially at the intersection of biology/software/hardware. You can follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/tomopencell) where I post project updates etc. This webpage is mostly lecture material, my personal projects, some project ideas and my bio. 

This year (Oct 2019 - June 2020) I am lecturing on Biofashion at the Royal College of Art. I'll be using this webpage to share the lecture materials and project work. Two things that really matter to me are opensource learning materials accessible to all and making those materials easy to use. So if you are based in a country where English is not your first language please let me know if there are ways I can help? In particular I would like to increase accessibility for Mandarin speakers. If you speak Mandarin please reach out!

### RCA Coursework/lectures
---
1. Week 9th October - [How to do a Literature Review](https://github.com/tmopencell/literaturereview)
Lit review used to involve libraries. Not anymore. Google, Mendeley, Ctrl+F and MSword (or latex) are your friends.  
2. Week 23rd October - [Build Your Own Computer](https://github.com/tmopencell/diycomputer)
A workshop where participants will participate in the building of three different types of computer/laptop. We will then do a crash course on getting started with coding. 
3. Week 30th October - [Forage and Culture Mycelia](https://www.opencell.bio/post/cloning-fungi)
A workshop delivered by Ashley Granter, Founder of Natura Studios. 
4. Week 8th November - [Design with the Living SYMPOSIUM @ Design Museum](https://designmuseum.org/whats-on/talks-courses-and-workshops/design-with-the-living)
Exhibition and as a part of the Design Museum London's courses and workshops.
5. Week 20th Novermber - [Dying Clothes with Bacteria]()
A hands on workshop using _Streptomyces_ to produce Indigo. 

### The projects I am working on right now 
---

- [OpenSource Plate reader](https://github.com/tmopencell/OSP)
This will be part of a [Hackathon October 26th](https://www.opencell.bio/biohack-here-now). If you want to participate then drop us a mail (info[@]opencell[dot]bio). 

- [IOT DIY Incubator](https://github.com/tmopencell/diyincubator)
I have come across a lot of old incubators that use old mercury thermometers. In general they are robust and if they still work it is useful to be able to digitally set, record and monitor the temperature and growth stage of your bacteria. Can be done very cheaply. 

- [Lab Vision](https://github.com/tmopencell/labvision)
This incorperates some OpenCV (was my first attempt at using for a project) and is supposed to track particular colours in an image for use in managing labs. It would also be possible to incorperate **hand tracking and then use this for experimental debugging**. We will do a [hackathon Nov 30th](https://www.opencell.bio/biohack-here-now) on this topic. 

### The projects I want to work on soon
---

- [Make Things Float With Ultrasound](https://spectrum.ieee.org/geek-life/hands-on/how-to-make-things-float-with-ultrasound). Ths project is based on work from the Drinkwater labs and I think it would (maybe?) have some application in biology apart from looking cool (maybe.?). You can [buy a kit for 70$](https://www.makerfabs.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=508) so hope to have a go soon. 

- [Chi.bio](https://chi.bio) is an incredible chemostat and is just breathtakingly well engineered. I would like to build it to (among others things) get a deeper understanding of surface mount components and pcb design.

- [OpenKnit](https://hackaday.com/2014/02/20/openknit-the-open-source-knitting-machine/) looks like a very useful tool at the borders of tech and fashion (also great videos). It is a 2D knitting machine and the [build instructions](https://github.com/g3rard/OpenKnit) look very thorough and it is very affordable as well. Would like to collaborate with a fashion designer (especially if interested in knitwear) on this. Please reach out if it interests you!! 

### Bit of Background

**Biography:**

I am founder/director at [OpenCell](https://opencell.bio) London, where we build biotech labs in shipping containers. Prior to this I had founded another biotech [Cell-Free Technology](https://cell-free.tech) where we developed tools for high throughput protein analysis. 

I was an [Wellcome Interdisciplinary Fellow](https://www.synbio.cam.ac.uk/directory/tdm34), jointly hosted by the Biotechnology Dept (Hall Lab) and the Plant Sciences Dept (Haseloff Lab), developing hardware for synthetic biology. My previous role was as a research scientist for the Toshiba Cambridge Research Labs and [Cavendish Labs](https://www.sp.phy.cam.ac.uk/directory/thomas-david-meany) as a Marie Curie Fellow ([PICQUE](http://www.picque.eu/thomas-meany-er5/)) developing quantum technologies. I completed my PhD on the [direct laser inscription of quantum photonic circuits](https://youtu.be/I-yKke2cOcQ) in glass microchips in the the group of [Michael J. Withford](https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/michael-withford) and [M. J. Steel](http://physics.mq.edu.au/~msteel/index.html) in the [Centre for Ultrahigh bandwidth Devices for Optical Systems (CUDOS)](https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/organisations/arc-centre-for-ultrahigh-bandwidth-devices-for-optical-systems-cu), Australia. I did my B.Sc (1st) in the National University of Ireland, Galway. I first fell in love with optical physics (especially lasers) during an summer internship in École Polytechnique in the LOA with the group of Gilles Cheriaux. I like drumming and rowing.
