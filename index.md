## Thomas Meany (right now just a Jekyll template)

I am director at [OpenCell](https://opencell.bio) and enjoy working accross disciplines especially at the intersection of biology/software/hardware.

This term (Oct-Dec 2019) I am teaching Biofashion at the Royal College of Art. I'll be using this webpage to share the lecture materials and project work. Two things that really matter to me are opensource learning materials accessible to all and making those materials easy to use. So if you are based in a country where English is not your first language please let me know if there are ways I can help? In particular I would like to increase accessibility for Mandarin speakers. If you speak Mandarin please reach out!
